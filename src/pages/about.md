ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Darko. I write software, mainly for the web. I'm also a writer, speaker, community person, and Linux nerd. I enjoy working with the web platform, warts included, and I remember the IE6 days (yes, I've been in this industry for 15+ years now ðŸ˜Š).

### Darko in bullet points:

- I love technical challenges. Especially the ones where you have to get creative to make them work.
- I run a local JS meetup, [BeerJS Skopje](https://beerjs.mk/). I helped start a local conference as well,
  [DevCon](https://devcon.dev).
- I'm a through-and-through Linux nerd.
- I also love gaming - PC, consoles, or tabletop (D&D especially).
- I love gardening, especially growing peppers - currently growing 20+ species, of the extremely hot ones. I'm also into making hot sauce.
- I used to draw and paint to relax. I also had an exhibition once. I'll get back to it one of these days ðŸ˜…

Generally, I'm not looking for a new job. Unless you may have a DevRel position open, for which I'd be happy to
talk :) I'm also glad to help with any kind of community effort/conference org/meetup, etc.
