> DevRel is about development and relationships. It's in the name.

Let's kick this one off with a question. Why do people go to conferences? Meetups? Easy answer, one might think - enthusiasm. I tend to agree with that, being an active event goer myself. I'm additionally motivated by my drive to move to a DevRel career, sure. But, even before I had the idea of becoming a DevRel person, I enjoyed tech events. Most of them anyway.

Going to a conference or a meetup usually means getting exposed to new ideas or learning something new. So, we can probably agree that there is **educational value** to these kinds of events. What about the other side of events, though? Not the organizers' perspective ([I've covered that before]()), rather the DevRel people that attend for various reasons. Whether speakers, sponsor-sent representatives or otherwise - what's the primary drive of these people? I'm not a betting man, but I'd wager that a very small number of my readers would respond with "to educate" as a first choice. Maybe a second or third, but certainly not first. They certainly have interesting things to say, but it's often driven by a product or a service they are trying to advocate for. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but that's not what DevRel is about. At least, not primarily.

So, to summarize - people pay money (sometimes) and come to get exposed to new ideas and learn, not to see you advertise your company.

## So, what <u>is</u> DevRel anyway?

To me, DevRel can be summarized in three words - education, relations and engineering. Let's dive into each.

### 1. Education

One of the pillars of what DevRel is, is education. Your own, as a DevRel and that of your developer audience.

> Teaching is the meta-strength.



### 2. Relations

### 3. Engineering
