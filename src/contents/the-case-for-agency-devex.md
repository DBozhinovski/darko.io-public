Traditionally^1, when we think of DevEx in any of its shapes, we think of product companies. Alternatively, large enterprisey settings that also have a bunch of different products. 

As I often find myself working with agencies and agency-like settings, it got me thinking. Does DevEx make sense for that setting? For some context, I took an interest in DevRel and I'm actively looking to switch careers to DevRel
