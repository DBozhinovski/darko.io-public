Traditionally[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-traditionally), when we think of DevEx in any of its shapes, we think of product companies. Alternatively, large enterprisey settings that also have a bunch of different tech products, aimed at developers - think AWS, GCP etc.

As I often find myself working with agencies and agency-like settings, it got me thinking. Does having a DevEx department/people make sense for these environments? I suspect the question arose from me taking an active interest in DevRel and looking to switch careers to it. Still, it is an interesting conundrum - what's the value proposition of DevEx for a commercial entity whose main export is talent? Put another way, if your main "product" are developers[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-product), what use do you have for DevEx? 

In my quest to answer that question, I read plenty of DevRel and DevEx material, talked to people that do DevRel in agencies (yes, they do exist) and talked to people that run agencies and have no idea what DevRel even is. The summary? It makes sense. And I'm hoping to make a compelling case for it.

## DevEx? DevRel? 

> DevEx = Developer Experience. DevRel = Developer Relations.

Let's start with a few quotes and prior art.



To quote [getclockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/what-is-developer-experience#:~:text=As%20a%20software%20company,%20developer,conducive%20to%20their%20best%20work.):

> As a software company, developer experience encompasses the experiences of your internal software developers as they carry out their work. That involves making sure their tools, processes, and working environment are all conducive to their best work. But thatâ€™s not the only way of looking at DX.

And to quote [whatisdevrel](https://www.whatisdevrel.com):

> DevRel, also known as Developer Relations or Developer Advocacy, is a role that exists at developer tool companies (companies whose target market is developers). Developer Advocates help educate developers on a specific product or technology through building community, creating content, and improving the developer experience of a product.

According to the latter quote, we can call it a day. No point in doing anything DevRel in agencies, as they don't deal with developer tooling externally, for the most part. Thing is, I vehemently disagree with that view. Still, [whatisdevrel](https://www.whatisdevrel.com) is a good read. I'd recommend going through it to understand what it is that DevRel people do. Especially if you happen to be new to the idea.

Back to my disagreement - let's go through each aspect of DevRel and DevEx engineering, as described by [whatisdevrel](https://www.whatisdevrel.com).

## Community

Most dev agencies, especially the big ones, have a percentually significant pool of developers as employees. They may work on different projects, but more often than not, they have at least some overlap in the tech they use. They share a space (virtual or physical), they go to the same company events. In a nutshell, they are a community.

Communities need nurturing. HR departments do that to an extent, but not completely. And to no fault of their own - HR people usually aren't techies or developers. While they often do a good job of understanding us as people and professionals, there is a certain special "je ne sais quoi" that only a developer can fully grasp. From the perspective of a theoretical agency DevRel - the reasoning is simple - you, as a developer, have already been in the boots of the person you're nurturing the community for. The way you emphatize with developers will always, by definition, be different than how HR can emphatize with developers.

In contrast to external community building, you're not nurturing your community primarily for the purpose of having external developer mindshare. Rather, you're doing it for the benefit of your own  developer colleagues.
