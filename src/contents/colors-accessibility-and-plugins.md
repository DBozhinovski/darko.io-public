I'm a tab hoarder. I have 30+ open in my browser(s) at any given time, and I'm using four devices. Aside from the fact that it makes me feel something like [this](https://i.redd.it/hk54ti5n6tk11.png), it has an unexpected upside - especially on mobile devices. Once you press that tab button that allows you to see all your ~~garbage~~ tabs, you can get an overview of all those things that captured your attention for one reason or another. The benefit of that overview is coming up with some exciting and unexpected connections. You could ascribe any semblance of creativity I have to that process - be chaotic, find links in said chaos, and try building something useful out of it.

This brings me to today's topic - plugins for CSS macro systems and UI libraries. They are seemingly unrelated and yet share a lot. For a while, probably longer than a few months, I had three tabs open in my phone's browser for completely unrelated reasons:
 - https://reasonable.work/colors/
 - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins
 - https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme

I had some previous experience customizing color themes for Tailwind, as I used reasonable colors there for a project in which accessibility was essential.
