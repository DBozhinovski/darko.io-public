This one isn't related to [BeerJS Skopje](https://beerjs.mk), but it is a lovely story worth sharing. So, swag corner story no. 1:

Last year, before the holidays, I was in a horrible place professionally. First, being severely burned out, primarily from the oh-so-lovely startup hustle culture. So I decided to take some time off and not work for a bit.

I was at a loss about what I'd like to do next. A career switch was in the cards, but I still needed to figure out what.

Along came [Sandra Stojƒçeviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABMDaJ4BMFctv7hLhkH_c7zqwLe0ZU8A038?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BnXky5EUmR9GUwbfFa9GAmA%3D%3D) from [Software Sauna](https://www.linkedin.com/company/softwaresauna/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BnXky5EUmR9GUwbfFa9GAmA%3D%3D), messaging me that they were looking to expand to Macedonia. They seemed like a cool and principled bunch, and I was getting bored out of my mind anyway, so I started working with them (a really cool company btw, check them out).

As luck would have it, they had a team-building thing planned in Croatia (Vodnjan, to be precise), so I went for it.

Item 1: Chokanche, as we call them in Macedonia, from Software Sauna.

Now, I won't go into a lot of details, but let's say that Finns give us Balkan people a run for our money when it comes to drinking. But rakija is still the superior drink. We can debate whose rakija is better after 3-4 shots. Nazdravje! üçª
