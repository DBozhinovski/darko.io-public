Without getting too heavily into stereotypes, we developers tend towards being on the "wallflower" side of the spectrum. I'm no exception, even though [I'm actively taking](https://beerjs.mk) [part in some](https://codepub.dev) [not-so-introverted](https://deved.mk) [activities](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCyVHiEXMOHaVGbnKuU4VA). That's all good and well, but we are naturally social beings. Especially when it comes to problem-solving, learning, and sharing knowledge. So, it stands to reason that by collaborating with others, we can achieve more than we can on our own. Let's dive into why it's important to be part of a community as a developer.

## The selfish angle

I will try building an answer for this from the "selfish" point of view, i.e., what's in it for you as an individual. To me, the primary value of being a part of a community is about having a network of support and a group to rely on. Let's explore what this means in practice.

### Having a network (of support)

The more connections you have, the more opportunities you'll have. Communities of like-minded individuals are precisely the place to build these connections. These opportunities can vary from finding a new job, finding a freelance gig, or collaborating on something (FOSS or otherwise). Additionally, whenever you get stuck on a problem or need a second opinion, you can always reach out to the group for help. If, at any point in this paragraph, you thought, "but this sounds like a company" - you're right. A company is also a community in many senses but with the profit motive added on top. It's a group of people working together towards a common goal. The difference is that the goal is not to make money but to help each other out (even though some collabs can lead to making money).

The two primary transactions one can make in a community are sharing what they know and learning something from the group. Let's go deeper into each and see how they can benefit you.

#### Learning from others (and getting info in general)

There's always something new to learn, whether you're just starting out or are longer in the tooth. While no two people learn the same way, having someone to ask always helps. Or having a group of someones to ask, for that matter.

When it comes to development, whether you're starting out on a new library/framework or you're stuck deep into [Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug) land, technical documentation, videos, or blogs can only get you so far. At some point, you're bound to hit a wall with something ill-documented, maybe a new bug or something else. Maybe you're on the fence about whether to use a certain tech. Or you might need a recommendation on what to use for your next app. This is exactly where having a community to ask for help can be a lifesaver.

Another point I'd like to make here is the one about getting information in general, not just for the sake of learning. Most of my freelance gigs, projects and employment opportunities have come from people I know professionally. And most of the people I know professionally are from the communities I'm a part of. This is not to say that you should join a community just to get a job. But it's a nice side effect of being a part of one.

#### Sharing your knowledge (and work)

One of the easiest ways to get noticed and build a brand for yourself is sharing what you know. This can be in the form of blog posts, videos, talks, or even just tweets. The more you share, the more people will know about you and your work. This can lead to more opportunities, as mentioned above. But it can also lead to more people reaching out to you for help. This is a great way to build your network and get to know more people. And, as we've established, having a network is a good thing. Online communities are an excellent place to share your work and knowledge. They're also a great place to get feedback on your work and knowledge. This can help you improve and grow as a developer.

However, it's important to note that sharing just for the sake of sharing isn't too valuable. The content you create, find, curate and share should be relevant to the community you chose to be a part of. Otherwise, you're just spamming. And nobody likes spam. Put another way, you should be sharing things that you would like to see in the community. Stuff that's valuable to you and that you think will be valuable to others. Finding out what that is can be a bit tricky, and can take some time. But it's worth it. Experiment, see what people react to. Iterate.

The bottom line is that you can view a community as a "stage" of sorts. A place where you can share your work, build in public and build a personal brand. If you're not comfortable with that, you can always just lurk and learn. But I'd encourage you to try and share something. You'll be surprised at how much you can learn from the feedback you get. Additionally, people tend to share what they like and find value in. So, if you hit that value sweet spot (and that's a matter of iteration), you'll get more people to share your work. This can lead to more opportunities, as mentioned above.

Had enough of the "selfish" angle? Let's look at the other side of the coin.

## The other side of the coin

There's plenty of benefits to being a part of a community as an individual. But there's also a lot of benefits to the community itself. The point I'd like to make here is that being an (active) member of a community is a win-win scenario. Beyond the "free audience" point we made above, there's something to be said about the community as an organism.

Consider this - if each member started from the "selfish" point of view, this is still a win-win scenario for everyone involved. None of us know everything (alone). Those that know a certain thing can share for their own benefit and "free stage". Those that seek knowledge can learn. It's a symbiotic system. And it's a system that can grow and evolve.
