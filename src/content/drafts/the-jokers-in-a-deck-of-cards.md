In our industry, there are those that don't feel like we easily fit into a single box. Being one of those people, I've felt somewhat constrained when hired for a "front-end" or a "back-end" role. I've felt more at home at the very vaguely defined "full-stack" role, but those roles can sometimes get a bit overwhelming. While I do enjoy the challenge of learning new things, infra and cloud stuff makes me want to cry. It's me AWS, it's not you.

Now, the benefits of doing the cloudy stuff aren't lost on me - but I prefer setting my own application server, http servers etc. I don't dislike automation, but I like understanding what's going on "under the hood" without having to wade through pages of (usually not great) documentation or getting consultants that point me towards one of the thousand available methods to load balance something. Okay, rant over, back to the topic at hand.

What really inspired me to write this post is the following [LinkedIn exchange](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7117142861547999232/):

Bojan's analogy is pretty amazing and spot on, for multiple reasons.
