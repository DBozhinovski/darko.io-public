In our industry, there are those that don't feel like we easily fit into a single box. Being one of those people, I've felt somewhat constrained when hired for a "front-end" or a "back-end" role. I've felt more at home at the very vaguely defined "full-stack" role, but those roles can sometimes get a bit overwhelming. While I do enjoy the challenge of learning new things, infra and cloud stuff makes me want to cry. It's me AWS, it's not you.

Now, the benefits of doing the cloudy stuff aren't lost on me - but I prefer setting my own application server, http servers etc. I don't dislike automation, but I like understanding what's going on "under the hood" without having to wade through pages of (usually not great) documentation or getting consultants that point me towards one of the thousand available methods to load balance something. Okay, rant over, back to the topic at hand.

## The conversation that sparked this post

What really inspired me to write this post is the following [LinkedIn exchange](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7117142861547999232/):

and the comment that followed:

Bojan's analogy is good and spot on, for multiple reasons. Having a flexible skillset does make you more valuable in the sense that you can jump in at any end of the proverbial stack and fill a role. Does that come with monetary benefits? Debatable, but in my experience it doesn't make that much of a difference. Should it? I could argue that it should, but that's a topic for another post.

"Jokers" feel like a very accurate analogy to what the generalist role usually is - a placeholder card, maybe a trump card depending on the game. Which is exactly what a generalist does - fill in a need or provide insights/big picture ideas to a project.

Being in such a role comes with a set of tradeoffs - some great, some not so much. Let's dig deeper into those.

## The full-stack developer of yore

In the olden days, there was no such thing as stacks. I remember a time when front-end amounted to negotiating with the browser (I haven't forgiven you IE) not to screw up the HTML, CSS and maybe some JS that you neatly packaged into a page via a templating engine. People that called themselves front-end developers invoked a very different set of ideas about what they did than what we do today. More often than not, there were expectations that you'd be able to do some design work, often using Photoshop - we used to have people that did ["slicing"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicing_(interface_design)>). It totally made sense though. The web was a very different place than what it is today, tech wise. So, if you were into web development, you were called a web developer. No front-end or back-end about it, let alone full-stack.

But a chain of events happened that caused two important things: JavaScript got better as a language and the Web Platform got decent to work with. Naturally, people started doing more and more stuff in the browser - there's no need to ignore the processing power of an entire machine just because you're used to sending stuff from the server. So the front-end started taking on a different meaning than what we previously thought. As a consequence, the role of a front-end developer started being a thing.

Naturally, those that were into web development but still disliked JavaScript (which frankly, was often the default) stuck to the back-end. In effect, the classical web developer turned into what we nowadays think of as a back-end developer. This is, of course, simplified, and probably biased, but to me it feels like a good approximation of the evolution of the web developer role.

That leaves us weirdos that liked both sides of the coin. I grew to love JavaScript and the Web Platform a lot, but I still liked doing back-end stuff.

## The generalist role today
