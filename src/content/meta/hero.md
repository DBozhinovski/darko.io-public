👋 Hi! I write software, mostly for the web platform.

👥 I run a branch of [BeerJS](https://beerjs.mk) and I'm one of the curators of the global BeerJS.

🗣️ I love public speaking! I've spoken at both [meetups and conferences](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCyVHiEXMOHaVGbnKuU4VA). I'm open to speaking at your event, feel free to [reach out](/contact)!

📝 I also [write](/blog), mostly about web development, community, content creation and anything that lies at the intersection of those.

📻 I'm the host of [CodePub](https://codepub.dev), a bi-weekly tech podcast with a focus on people.
